        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Brandied Fruit Day, observed annually on October 20th, celebrates the rich, boozy preserve made by soaking various fruits—such as cherries, peaches, or apricots—in brandy, often with sugar and spices. This traditional method not only preserves the fruit but also infuses it with a complex flavor profile, making it a popular addition to desserts, cocktails, or simply enjoyed on its own.</p>
        <p>Observed each year on October 20, Brandied Fruit Day invites people to pause, share the story, and bring a little themed joy to their day.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>Historically, brandying was a popular method of preserving fruit before refrigeration became widespread, allowing seasonal produce to be enjoyed year-round.</p>
        <p>The alcohol in brandy acts as a natural preservative, while also extracting and intensifying the fruit&#x27;s flavors, which often deepen and meld over several months.</p>
