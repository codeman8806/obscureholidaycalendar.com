        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Brisket Day, observed annually on May 28th, celebrates the popular cut of beef known for its rich flavor and versatility. Derived from the lower chest or breast of a cow, brisket is often prepared through slow-cooking methods like smoking, braising, or roasting, which break down its tough connective tissues to achieve a tender, succulent result. It is a staple in many culinary traditions, from American barbecue to Jewish holiday meals, cherished for its ability to feed a crowd and its deeply savory taste.</p>
        <p>Observed each year on May 28, Brisket Day invites people to pause, share the story, and bring a little themed joy to their day.</p>

        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>The term &quot;brisket&quot; originates from the Middle English &quot;brusket,&quot; derived from the Old Norse &quot;brjósk&quot; meaning cartilage.</p>
        <p>A full-packer brisket can take anywhere from 8 to 18 hours to smoke properly, due to its high connective tissue content that requires long, slow cooking to tenderize.</p>
