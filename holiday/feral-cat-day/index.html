        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>National Feral Cat Day, observed annually on October 16th, is a day dedicated to raising awareness about community cats (feral and stray cats) and advocating for humane and effective management strategies, primarily Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) programs. It aims to educate the public about the challenges these unowned cats face, promote their welfare, and highlight the importance of responsible caretaking to control populations and improve their lives.</p>
        <p>Observed each year on October 16, Feral Cat Day invites people to pause, share the story, and bring a little themed joy to their day.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>Feral cats are distinct from stray cats; strays are lost or abandoned pets, while feral cats are born and live in the wild, typically avoiding human contact.</p>
        <p>Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) programs involve humanely trapping feral cats, sterilizing them, vaccinating them, and returning them to their outdoor homes, which prevents further reproduction and stabilizes colony populations.</p>
