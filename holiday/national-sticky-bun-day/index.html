        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>Sticky buns are a classic treat associated with Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine, where they are sometimes called &quot;schnecken,&quot; meaning &quot;snails&quot; in German, due to their spiral shape.</p>
        <p>The signature &#x27;sticky&#x27; quality comes from a generous coating of caramel or butterscotch syrup, often made with brown sugar, butter, and sometimes honey, which bakes onto the bottom of the buns.</p>
