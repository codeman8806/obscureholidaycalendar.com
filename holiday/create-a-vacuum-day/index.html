        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Create a Vacuum Day, observed annually on February 4th, is an unofficial, whimsical holiday that encourages individuals to explore or simply ponder the scientific concept of a true vacuum—a space utterly devoid of matter. While achieving a perfect vacuum is practically impossible on Earth, the day serves as an opportunity to learn about the physics and applications of vacuums in technology, and to consider the profound implications of emptiness.</p>
        <p>Observed each year on February 4, Create a Vacuum Day invites people to pause, share the story, and bring a little themed joy to their day.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>A perfect vacuum, meaning a space entirely devoid of all matter, is theoretically impossible to achieve due to factors like quantum fluctuations.</p>
        <p>Outer space, while often considered a vacuum, is not truly empty; it contains sparse particles, electromagnetic radiation, and dark matter.</p>
