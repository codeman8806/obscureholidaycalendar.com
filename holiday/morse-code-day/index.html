        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Morse Code Day, observed annually on April 27th, commemorates the birth of Samuel Morse in 1791, the co-developer of Morse code and a pioneer of the electric telegraph. This day honors his monumental contribution to long-distance communication, which revolutionized information exchange across continents and industries. While largely superseded by modern digital technologies, Morse code remains relevant in amateur radio, aviation (for navigational aid identification), and as a celebrated historical communication method, appreciated for its simplicity, efficiency, and profound impact on global connectivity.</p>
        <p>Observed each year on April 27, Morse Code Day invites people to pause, share the story, and bring a little themed joy to their day.</p>

        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>The very first message sent via electric telegraph using Morse code was &quot;What hath God wrought?&quot;, transmitted by Samuel Morse on May 24, 1844.</p>
        <p>The international distress signal &quot;SOS&quot; (three dots, three dashes, three dots) is one of the most widely recognized Morse code sequences.</p>
