        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>The tradition of carving faces into vegetables originated in Ireland, where people carved turnips or potatoes, not pumpkins, to ward off evil spirits.</p>
        <p>Pumpkins became the preferred carving vegetable in North America because they are native to the continent and much larger and easier to carve than turnips.</p>
