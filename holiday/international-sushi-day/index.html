        <p>Sushi originally began as a method for preserving fish in Southeast Asia, where fermented rice was used to wrap and preserve fish, not eaten with it.</p>
        <p>The word &#x27;sushi&#x27; actually refers to the vinegared rice, not the raw fish itself. Raw fish served without rice is called &#x27;sashimi.&#x27;</p>
