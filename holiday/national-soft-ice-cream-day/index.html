        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>The origins of soft serve are widely attributed to several figures, including Tom Carvel (whose ice cream truck broke down in 1934) and Dairy Queen (which began serving soft serve in 1938).</p>
        <p>Soft serve is typically served at a higher temperature (around 25°F or -4°C) than traditional hard-scooped ice cream, contributing to its smoother, less icy texture.</p>
