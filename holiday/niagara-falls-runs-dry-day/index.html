        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>March 29th marks the anniversary of a unique event in 1969 when the American Falls, one of the three waterfalls that make up Niagara Falls, was intentionally dewatered for several months. This was not a natural occurrence or an annual holiday, but a significant engineering project undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to study the erosion of the cliff face and consider options for stabilization, offering a rare glimpse of the exposed riverbed.</p>
        <p>Observed each year on March 29, Niagara Falls Runs Dry Day invites people to pause, share the story, and bring a little themed joy to their day.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>Only the American Falls were dewatered; the larger Canadian Horseshoe Falls continued to flow uninterrupted.</p>
        <p>A 600-foot-long temporary rock and earth dam was constructed upstream to divert the Niagara River&#x27;s flow away from the American Falls.</p>
