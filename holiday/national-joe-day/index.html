        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>The name Joseph, from which Joe is derived, has ancient biblical origins and remains one of the most consistently popular male names globally.</p>
        <p>One popular theory for the origin of the colloquial term &#x27;cup of Joe&#x27; for coffee links it to Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, who famously banned alcohol on naval ships in 1914.</p>
