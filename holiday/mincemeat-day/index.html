        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Mincemeat Day, observed annually on October 26th, celebrates the rich, sweet, and spiced preserve traditionally used as a filling for pies, particularly popular during the Christmas season. Originating in medieval times, mincemeat was once a mixture of chopped meat, suet, fruit, and spices, but it has largely evolved into a vegetarian blend of dried fruits, apples, citrus peel, warming spices, and often brandy or rum, encased in pastry to form festive tarts and pies.</p>
        <p>Observed each year on October 26, Mincemeat Day invites people to pause, share the story, and bring a little themed joy to their day.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>Historically, mincemeat recipes included actual chopped meat, such as beef or venison, which helped preserve the mixture before refrigeration.</p>
        <p>By the Victorian era, the meat content in mincemeat had largely been replaced by suet, and the mixture became predominantly fruit-based, sweet, and heavily spiced.</p>
