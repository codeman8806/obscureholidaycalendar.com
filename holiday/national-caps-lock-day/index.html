        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>National Caps Lock Day, observed annually on October 22nd, is an unofficial, humorous holiday dedicated to the &quot;Caps Lock&quot; key on computer keyboards. It encourages people to type in all capital letters for a day, often playfully mimicking the online etiquette of &quot;shouting&quot; or expressing strong emotions. While it&#x27;s largely a lighthearted jest, it serves as a quirky reminder of a keyboard function that is sometimes overused or accidentally engaged.</p>
        <p>Observed each year on October 22, National Caps Lock Day invites people to pause, share the story, and bring a little themed joy to their day.</p>

        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>The holiday was reportedly created in 2000 by a programmer named Derek Arnold, who found humor in the key&#x27;s perceived misuse.</p>
        <p>The Caps Lock key originated from the &#x27;Shift Lock&#x27; key on typewriters, designed to type entire sections in uppercase without continuously holding down the Shift key.</p>
