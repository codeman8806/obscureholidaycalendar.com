        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Deep Dish Pizza Day, observed annually on April 5th, is a celebration of the iconic Chicago-style deep-dish pizza. This unique culinary creation is characterized by its tall, pie-like crust that forms a deep basin, filled with generous layers of cheese (often mozzarella on the bottom), various toppings, and finished with a rich, chunky tomato sauce on top. The day encourages enthusiasts to indulge in and appreciate this hearty and distinctive pizza, which requires a longer baking time due to its substantial thickness.</p>
        <p>Observed each year on April 5, Deep Dish Pizza Day invites people to pause, share the story, and bring a little themed joy to their day.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>Pizzeria Uno in Chicago is widely credited with inventing the deep-dish pizza in 1943.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional pizzas, deep-dish is typically assembled with cheese directly on the crust, followed by toppings, and finally the tomato sauce, which helps prevent the cheese from burning during its long bake.</p>
