        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>May Day, observed on May 1st, holds a dual significance: it is an ancient spring festival celebrating fertility, nature&#x27;s renewal, and the arrival of warmer weather, often marked by traditions such as maypole dancing and floral decorations. Concurrently, it is widely recognized as International Workers&#x27; Day (or Labour Day in many countries), a commemoration of the historic struggles and achievements of the labor movement, particularly advocating for workers&#x27; rights and the eight-hour workday, stemming from events like the Haymarket affair in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Observed each year on May 1, May Day invites people to pause, share the story, and bring a little themed joy to their day.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>The maypole, a central feature of many traditional May Day celebrations, originated from ancient pagan spring fertility rites in Europe.</p>
        <p>International Workers&#x27; Day, celebrated by over 80 countries on May 1st, commemorates the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago and the global struggle for workers&#x27; rights.</p>
