        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>Cellophane tape was invented by Richard Drew, a 3M engineer, in 1930, after he originally developed masking tape for painters.</p>
        <p>The iconic &#x27;Scotch&#x27; brand name is rumored to have originated from a complaint by an early customer, who, unhappy with the amount of adhesive, supposedly told 3M to &#x27;tell your Scotch bosses to put more adhesive on this tape!&#x27;</p>
