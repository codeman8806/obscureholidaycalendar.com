        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>The origin of the ice cream sundae is widely debated, with towns like Ithaca, New York, and Two Rivers, Wisconsin, both claiming its invention in the late 19th century.</p>
        <p>The name &#x27;sundae&#x27; is thought to have emerged as a workaround for &#x27;Sunday laws&#x27; or &#x27;blue laws&#x27; that prohibited the sale of ice cream sodas on Sundays, leading to the creation of an ice cream and syrup combination without the soda.</p>
