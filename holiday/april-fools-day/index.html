        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>April Fools&#x27; Day is an annual tradition observed on April 1st, where people play practical jokes and hoaxes on friends, family, and colleagues. While not a public holiday, it is widely recognized as a day for light-hearted deception, with pranks typically revealed by shouting &quot;April Fools!&quot; to conclude the joke.</p>
        <p>Observed each year on April 1, April Fools&#x27; Day invites people to pause, share the story, and bring a little themed joy to their day.</p>

        <h2>Origin and story</h2>
        <p>Its origins are debated, but a common theory links it to the 16th-century adoption of the Gregorian calendar, when those still celebrating the New Year on April 1st were mocked.</p>
        <p>In France, Italy, and French-speaking Canada, an April Fool is called a &quot;poisson d&#x27;avril&quot; (April fish), often involving children taping a paper fish to an unsuspecting person&#x27;s back.</p>
